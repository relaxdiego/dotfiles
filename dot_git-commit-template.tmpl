# Subject
#
#   Examples:
#     - Add a preference that will customize behavior Y
#     - Simplify the logic needed to send out a notification

# Trailers

#   Trailers are good for tracking and also for `git interpret-trailers`.
#   git tools require trailers to be last in a commit message, and must
#   be one trailer per line, with no extra lines between.
#
#   Examples:
#     - See: Description <https://example.com/...>
#     - Co-authored-by: Name <name@example.com>
#     - Sponsored-by: Name <name@example.com>
